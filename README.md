# Corral

[![Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/tecuane/corral?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/tecuane/corral)

A dead-simple, quite-opinionated RBAC library for web applications.

Roughly similar to the basics of [CanCanCan](https://github.com/cancancommunity/cancancan) for Rails.

The library code is messy and brittle, and it uses reflection to catch a couple of cases, so it might not be as fast as it could be.

Check the test for example usage.
